# Bayesian Massive MIMO Channel Estimation with Parameter Estimation using Low-Resolution ADCs
* We aim to recover massive MIMO channels from quantizated measurments produced by low-reolution ADCs, we adopt the `AMP with built-in parameter estimation` (**AMP-PE**) [1,2] to solve this problem.
* AMP-PE offers a much simpler way to estimate the distribution parameters, which allows us to directly work with true quantization noise models.
